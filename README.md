Rstudio Spatial Vector demo
This is a demo put together by Eli Baldwin to demonstrate Rstudio's use for vector GIS data. The demo uses a shapefile which contains every county in the continental US. The demo uses the packages 'sf' and 'spdep' to perform various processes and analyses on the data, including spatial statistics, while also demonstrating some of the basic functioning of Rstudio.
